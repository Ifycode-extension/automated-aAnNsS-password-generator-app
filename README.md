How to use the App
Hi there! You only need the first letters from the words alphabeth, number & symbol to generate random characters for your password on the fly:

a generates random lowercase alphabeth
A generates random uppercase alphabeth
n or N generates random number
s or S generates random symbol
Password length must have between 8 - 64 characters for the copy button to be enabled.

About aAnNsS generator App
aAnNsS password generator app features are drawn from javascript development environment automation and Github's colorful percentage display of code that make up user's repo. The app is made up a genarator, analyser (graphical analysis of the password make up) and strength checker. Created during Google Africa Developers scholarship 2020 program (learning phase 2) with knowledge from the HTML5, CSS3, (vanilla) javascript & node.js courses provided. See details in github repo readme file. Thanks to my supportive big brothers: Obiagba Ndidi (helped with calculation for the analyser component), Obiagba Joseph & Obiagba Israel.
